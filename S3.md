# S3 - [back](README.md)


* secure, highly-scalable object storage
* store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web
* safe place to store your files
* size can be 0 bytes (yes, really) to 5 TB
* unlimited storage
* files are stored on buckets (i.e. folder)
* universal namespace and names must be unique globally
* https://s3-REGION_NAME.amazonaws.com/BUCKET
* successful upload receives HTTP 200
* built for 99.99% availability
    * Amazon guarantees 99.99% availability (access)
    * Amazon guarantees 99.999999999% durability (loss)

#### Data consistency model

* READ after WRITE consistency for new PUTS of objects
* EVENTUAL consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES of objects
    * can take some time to propagate
    * updates are atomic -- either the old or the new but never partial

#### Key/Value Storage

* Key - name of the object
    * add some randomness to keys with similar values
* Value - the actual data
* Version ID
* Metadata - data about the data
* Subresources
    * Access Control Lists - fine grain permissions
    * Torrent

#### Storage tiers

* S3 - 99.99% availability, 99.99999999999% durability
    * durable, immediately available, frequently accessed
* S3 IA - infrequent access. charged for retrieve, 99.9% availability, 99.9999999999% durability
    * durable, immediately availability, infrequently accessed
* Reduced Redundancy Storage - 99.99% availability, 99.99% durability
    * data that is easily reproducable (i.e. thumbnails)
* Glacier - 3-5 hours to retrieve
    * archived data

#### Costs

* Act of uploading is free (Data in is free)
* Charged for (Data out costs money)
    * storage
    * requests
    * storage management - tags for tracking
    * data transfer - upload is free; moving costs
    * transfer acceleration  - CDN


#### Creating S3 bucket
    * Buckets are universal name space
    * Upload an object to S3 receives HTTP 200
    * 3 types of storage
    * Encryption
        * client side
        * server side
            * Amazon S3 Managed keys
            * KMS
            * Customer provided keys
    * Access is controlled by ACL or bucket policy
    * By default, buckets are private and objects stored inside are private too
    * objects don't inherit bucket tags
    * Bucket limit is 100

#### Static Website hosting
    * To use Route 53 with a custom domain, the bucket name has to be the same as the domain name
    * URL is http://BUCKET_NAME.s3-website-REGION.amazonaws.com

#### Copy from S3 to local

```bash
aws s3 cp --recursive --region us-east-999 s3://BUCKET_NAME LOCAL_DIRECTORY
```
